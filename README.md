# AR Portfolio
## by ThreeDotZeroMedia

Thanks to the amazing community of open-source AR developers, it's finally become possible to experience augmented reality in a web browser, even on lower end devices, this has opened up access to a large user base. 
My passion for AR bring me here, to promote my services as an AR developer and to promote AR as an industry. I believe augmented reality only enhances our reality and does not subtract. That's why I love AR.

Thanks for your visit.
